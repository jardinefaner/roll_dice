# Udemy - Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide

This repository contains all the projects I have completed as part of the "Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide" Udemy course.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into modules, and each module has one or more projects.
Each project is a self-contained Flutter application.

## Projects

The projects in this repository are organized by module and lesson.
Each project has its own directory and can be run independently.

### Themes

All projects in this repository share a common theme.
The theme is defined in the `lib/core/theme` directory and is used by all projects.

### Modularity

The projects are designed to be modular.
Each project is a separate module and can be easily integrated into other projects.
